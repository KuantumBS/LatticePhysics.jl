# LatticePhysics


Lattice based calculations and plotting for Julia v.1.0.*


## Usage

To use the lattice library in your code, install it as specified below.
TO use it in your code, start by importing the library
```julia-REPL
julia> using LatticePhysics
```




## Installation:

You can use the package via the package mode in Julia (Pkg). However, since the package
is not listed in the Julia package repositories, you have to use
```julia
(v1.0) pkg> add "https://github.com/janattig/LatticePhysics.jl"
```

You will have to install all submodules listed below as well (individually):


## Sub-modules

The main code is divided into various sub-modules, which can be found here:
1.  [LatPhysBase](https://github.com/janattig/LatPhysBase.jl.git)
2.  [LatPhysUnitcellLibrary](https://github.com/janattig/LatPhysUnitcellLibrary.jl.git)
3.  [LatPhysLatticeConstruction](https://github.com/janattig/LatPhysLatticeConstruction.jl.git)
4.  [LatPhysLatticeModification](https://github.com/janattig/LatPhysLatticeModification.jl.git)
5.  [LatPhysReciprocal](https://github.com/janattig/LatPhysReciprocal.jl.git)
6.  [LatPhysLuttingerTisza](https://github.com/janattig/LatPhysLuttingerTisza.jl.git)
